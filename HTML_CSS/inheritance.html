<h1>Cascade of CSS Example</h1>
<h2>Subheading 1</h2>
<p>Inheritance allows us to write more global styles
on parent elements and then "find-tune" the styles for
some of the child elements as needed. Such approach makes
writing CSS very efficient.

<p>
    In CSS, inheritance controls what happens when no value is specified for a property on an element.
    inherited properties, which by default are set to the computed 
    value of the parent element. non-inherited properties, 
    which by default are set to initial value of the property.
