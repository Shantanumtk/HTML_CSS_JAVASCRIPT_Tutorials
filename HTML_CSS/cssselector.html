CSS-Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the 
presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
alongside HTML and JavaScript.

CSS selectors are used to determine which HTML element, or set of elements, to apply the CSS declarations to. 
The browser uses its selector API to traverse the DOM or Document Object Model,
and pick out the elements matching the selector. Now crafting a selector is a great skill to have and not only for styling using CSS. 
That's because a lot of JavaScript libraries out there use the browser selector API to attach behavior and data to HTML elements.

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. 
This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, 
enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity 
and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the 
 pages that share the file and its formatting.

Now crafting a selector is a great skill to have and not only for styling using CSS. That's because a lot of JavaScript 
libraries out there use the browser selector API to attach behavior and data to HTML elements. 
Much in the same way that CSS applies style to those elements. In this lecture, 
we're going to talk about three different types of selectors, element, class, and id selector.
<span id="mainPoint">id="mainPoint".</span>
