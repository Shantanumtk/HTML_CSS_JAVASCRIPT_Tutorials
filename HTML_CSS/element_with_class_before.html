CSS-Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the 
presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
alongside HTML and JavaScript.

Now crafting a selector is a great skill to have and not only for styling using CSS. That's because a lot of JavaScript 
libraries out there use the browser selector API to attach behavior and data to HTML elements. 
Much in the same way that CSS applies style to those elements. In this lecture, 
we're going to talk about three different types of selectors, element, class, and id selector.
